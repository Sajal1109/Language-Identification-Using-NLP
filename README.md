# Language Identification

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of three neural network architectures for the task of language identification, developed as part of the CSCI 5845 Natural Language Processing course. The project explores the effectiveness of Dense Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks in classifying texts into one of 17 languages.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Implement and compare three different neural network architectures for language identification.
- Evaluate the models based on accuracy, training time, and their ability to generalize on unseen data.
- Determine the most suitable neural network architecture for the task based on the comparative analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains approximately 10,000 text entries spread across 17 different languages.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Scikit-Learn
